# Millennium Ã— WICC Coinbase Sentiment Analysis Project

This repository contains my contributions to the **Coinbase Sentiment Analysis** project, conducted in collaboration with Millennium engineers through Women in Computing at Cornell (WICC).  
The work was presented to Millenniumâ€™s engineering team as part of our final showcase.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
The goal of this project was to analyze sentiment around Coinbase by processing Reddit data, performing sentiment scoring, and visualizing trends over time.

I followed an **iterative development process** documented across three Jupyter notebooks:

1. **`Millennium_Reddit_1st_Iteration.ipynb`** â€” *Initial Simulation*:  
   - Objective: Test pipeline for scraping Reddit data and running basic sentiment analysis.  
   - Issue: Data cleaning and sentiment scoring produced unreliable results due to noise in raw data.  
   - Outcome: Identified the need for more targeted data collection and preprocessing.

2. **`Millennium_Reddit_2nd_Iteration.ipynb`** â€” *Refined Data Pipeline*:  
   - Objective: Narrow subreddit scope, improve tokenization, and re-run analysis.  
   - Issue: Model still produced inconsistent sentiment scores due to stopword handling and preprocessing gaps.  
   - Outcome: Led to a complete overhaul of the preprocessing logic.

3. **`Millennium_Reddit_3rd_Iteration.ipynb`** â€” *Final Working Version*:  
   - Objective: Implement improved preprocessing, apply sentiment lexicons, and produce visualizations for trends.  
   - Outcome: Generated consistent sentiment metrics and clear visualizations, forming the basis for the final presentation.
